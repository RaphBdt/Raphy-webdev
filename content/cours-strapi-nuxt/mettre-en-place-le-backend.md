Welcome to this tutorial to learn how to create a blog with Nuxt for the frontend and Strapi for the backend. Let's go 🧑‍💻

## Why Strapi?

The advantage of Strapi compared to other CMS (WordPress, Prestashop...) is that it allows you to create controllers in order to change the native behavior of the backend. It is therefore completely adjustable according to your needs. In addition, Strapi natively creates an API, so the frontend is completely decoupled from the backend. It's the new way to build modern apps 🚀

## Créer un nouveau projet

    npx create-strapi-app@latest my-blog

Move inside your new project and start the server :

    cd my-blog
    npm run develop

On first login, you are prompted to choose a username and password.
